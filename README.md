About:  An app to collect customer information to be added to a waitlist for a restaurant using React, Firebase, and Tailwind.

Purpose:  I was inspired by the Yelp waitlist App after using it at a restaurant and thought I'd give it a shot! Also thougth I would give firebase a shot after using MongoDB

Likes:  I always enjoy firebase because it hooks right up to the client so there is no need for any APIs, it's fast and there's a lot of documentation behind it.

Difficulties:  I was not aware that UseEffect now renders twice on load and I was stumped there for a minute but in the end it was good because it taught me how to deal with that update and I was able to catch the issue the next time it came up! - Update I learned it renders twice when in StrincMode!

Time:  Took 20 hours. I got stuck because I was not aware I had to use user authentication to manipulate data in the database.
